      <h2>Gap of Dunloe</h2>
      <p>
        <abbr title="In Irish/Gaelic: Dún Lóich">Gap of Dunloe</abbr> is a narrow mountain pass
        running north-south in Count Kerry, Ireland. It separates the

        range in the East. The Gap of Dunloe was formed 25000 years ago during Ireland's last ice
        age as a result from a glacial break that moved out from its position and made the U-shape
        that is known as The Gap today.<br />
        It is one of the Kerry's most popular tourist destinations on account of its scenery. Often
        used for hill walking and rock climbing, but the main tourist attraction is walking the
        narrow road from Kate Kearney's Cottage at the start of the Gap to Lord Brandon's Cottage at
        the end of the Gap.

        landing in Cashel. <br />
